This is the wiki for the pen-and-paper-rpg story/setting :3

As the currently running story is centered around of Vienna, most of this
wiki will describe the situation and characters of ethrium-world
Europe/Austria/Vienna. If you want to pick up the setting for your own
campaign, feel free to either also use add to this wiki or fork it, as
is most suited for your group. :)

# A Short History

The story is set in a what-if deviation of our world, in which a global
catastrophe occurred around 1848 that altered the course of history. Severe
meteorite showers devastated large parts of the world and introduced a yet
unknown material with high energy density, latter dubbed "Ethrium" to the
earth. What was started by the direct destruction by the meteorites, was
finished by dust-storms containing the material as well as highly destructive
Ethrium-age wars over control of it - large regions (e.g. most of France and
south-eastern Europe ) were essentially rendered uninhabitable.

However this new material also lead to a burst of technological advancement,
both due to the high energy density of the material as well as it's
"inspiration-enhancing" effects on being exposed to it for prolonged
periods of time or even stronger, when imbibing it. These technological jumps
also was responsible for some critical shifts in power-balances.

<!--
Next to the surface-sources of ethrium from the the meteorites, weirdly
enough also underground reserves have been found, leading to wild speculation
among leading scientists on the nature of ethrium.
As far as conventional research wisdom goes, the meteorites somehow caused synthesis/transformation
of precursor materials or somehow activated
or activated
alternative
at great depths + only detectable with ethrium-based sensorics? (goes well with souls/hel metapher)
