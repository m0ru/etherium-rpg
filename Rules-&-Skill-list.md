## Characters 

### Skills

-   Skill Pyramid: | skills@lv(n) | &gt;= | skills@lv(n + 1) |

### Aspects 

character generation:

-   1 high concept (main motivation!, sums char in one phrase)
-   1 trouble (recurring complication)
-   5 other aspects

In action:

-   Whoever uncovers/creates an aspect, gets a free tag on it
-   May be compelled / invoked (see Fate Point section)

### Stunts & Powers

See further down

## Action!

Combined skills: ą1 if secondary is higher/lower

-   Modifies: both directions
-   Complements: only +1 possible
-   Restricts: only -1 possible

### Non-conflict

-   Simple Actions: roll vs. difficulty; shifts for reducing time,
    increasing subtlety, increasing quality
-   Challenge: extended roll vs. set nr. of shifts
-   Contests: roll vs. roll
    -   Normal: no shifts (sometimes shifts may impart bonus for
        future roll)
    -   Consequential: loser takes consequence (+1 degree of severity
        per 2 full shifts)
    -   Extended:
        -   Race: finish line = nr. of requ. shifts
        -   Cat & mouse: fixed nr. of rolls, then compare accumulated;
            (opt.: +=consequential)
-   Assessments:
    -   Determine targets aspects
    -   Simple roll vs. difficulty / a characters skill-lv
    -   Contest if opp. is aware of assessment
    -   Possibly additional aspect at shift 3, 5, 7,...
    -   Guessing Aspects: if guessed right, roll may be skipped
-   Declarations:
    -   Instead of discovering, an aspect is thought up
    -   Normal assessment roll
    -   Success: aspect is there
    -   Failure: not there or character falsely believes its there

### Conflicts

1.  Frame the scene attern.
    -   Set up zones & scene aspects

2.  Establish the groups in the conflict.
3.  Establish initiative.
    -   Order by Alertness / Empathy / Discipline
    -   Break ties with Athletics / \[other relevant skill\]

4.  Begin the exchange.
    1.  Take actions.
        -   Attack
        -   Maneuver
        -   Block
        -   Sprint
        -   Full Defense (+2 on defense rolls)

    2.  Resolve actions.
    3.  Repeat step 4, beginning a new exchange.

5.  Ending the Conflict
    -   Losing by:
        -   Taken out (see Stress)
        -   Concession (see there)
    -   Loser always gets one FP per consequence taken in the conflict
    -   Reset stress track (unless next conflict follows)

### Actions

#### Attack:

Roll AttSkill vs. Defense

-   Success: or tie: shifts -&gt; stress
-   Failure: spin: ą1 to next acting characters action per 3 shifts of
    superior defense
-   Types:
    -   Physical: Fists, Guns, Weapons vs. Athlethics (dodge),
        Fists/Weapons (parry)
    -   Social: Deceit, Intimidation, Rapport vs. Empathy / Discipline
    -   Mental:
-   Spray attacks: split up roll on opponents before their defense rolls
-   Explosions & whole zone attacks: roll is against everyone in zone
-   Special effect attacks: secondary effect: make rolls vs. weapon
    rating (i.e. shock-stick)

#### Maneuver:

Success places or removes a temporary aspect on/from target or scene

-   0 shifts: fragile aspect (fades after 1 use)
-   =0 shifts: sticky aspect
-   Replace situational modifiers ("Flanking","Deep in Concentration")
-   Allow for teamwork ("Assistance from \[\]")
-   I.e. Blinding, Disarming, Cover, Aiming, Painting Target, Called
    Shots

#### BlocK:

-   Vs. some action
-   1 person, all actions OR 1 type of action and multiple people
-   block strength = roll
    -   needs to be beaten for blocked action
-   no maintaining (reroll per round)
-   Grapple:
    -   Initiate: invoke aspect on target, then roll might -&gt; block
        strength (all actions)
    -   No sprinting / supplemental move
    -   Opp. may act if beats block; grapple broken if makes sense
    -   Next round, auto: 1 shift hit OR 1 zone movement OR 1 maneuver;
        then roll grapple at -1

#### Sprint:

-   Roll vs. border (i.e. Athlethics), shifts for additional zones
    -   Open: 0
    -   Rough terrain: 1
    -   Fences: 2
    -   High walls/barbed wire: 3
-   Or: supplemental move (see below)

#### Supplemental Actions:

-   Part of other action
    -   Supplemental move (1 zone, no borders)
    -   Drawing a weapon to fire
    -   Opening a door to do sthg.
-   No die roll
-   -1 to main action

-   Any left-over shifts -&gt; 1 free non-offensive action at that
    "roll"
-   Must be in line with primary action

### Stress

Cuts, bruises, loss of composure/peace of mind, minor trauma

Resets at the end of conflicts

After attack:

1.  Consequences to reduce stress:
2.  Take X Stress -&gt; mark off box X on respective
    track (physical/social/mental)
    -   If occupied mark off next empty

3.  No boxes left to right -&gt; taken out
    -   Opponent defines fate (though details left to loser) &lt;-- own
        death scenes

#### Consequences

-   Are lasting effects
-   Heal only after some cause (medical/psycho-therapeuthical treatment)

| Lv       | Stress | Lasts after recovery starts             | Examples                                         |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| mild     | 2      | 1 scene                                 | bruised hand,winded,distracted,flustered         |
| moderate | 4      | end of next session                     | belly slash,exhausted,drunk,twisted ankle        |
| severe   | 6      | max{end of next scenario, 2-3 sessions} | broken leg,crippling shame,trauma-induced phobia |

-   Extreme consequences:
    -   Plot devices
    -   8 stress
    -   Only have one at a time, indep. of tracks
    -   Slot clears at major milestone or three scenarios
    -   Permanently replaces one of your aspects
    -   No healing speed up

### Concessions

-   Give up conflict
-   Before knock-out roll
-   Get to decide own fate (though it still must be a defeat)
    -   Moderate consequence, or
    -   Creates future problems, or
    -   Restricts behaviour (i.e. large debt) -&gt; temporary, long-term
        aspect
-   Must be accepted by group

### Weapons & Armor

Add bonus shifts if hit succeeded

| Type                                   | Dmg |
|----------------------------------------|-----|
| Pocket weapons,knives                  | 1   |
| Swords,pistols                         | 2   |
| 2-handed,hvy. pistols,rifles,automatic | 3   |
| Artillery,explosives                   | 4   |

Armor scaled to weapons they protect from. Tends to lag behind by 1.

### Poisons

see SotC

Fast Damaging Poison: Potency (Mediocre - Superb) vs Endurance at start
of round(s) till stopped (Treatment or spin (&gt;=3 shifts) for
defender)

Slow Damaging Poison: as for fast poison, once per scene. Shift for
poison: victim gets consequence. Per three such escalate along
minor-moderate-severe.

Exotic Drugs: Endurance vs. Potency, if victim fails -&gt; place aspect

-   These skills affect stress tracks =&gt; min(2 + ceil(lv/2), 4); +1
    mild consequence per 2 levels above Good)

š These trappings and skills appear in Spirit of the Century, rather
than Dresden Files

Other thoughts:

-   Piloting is a stunt of driving
-   Gambling is a stunt of deceive
-   Optional rule for skills like Art, Scholarship, etc.: limited to one
    field of expertise per rank (others can't be used at all or at a
    heavy penalty)
-   Optionally Scholarship might be split, to reflect a
    differentiation/focus of the campaign

Optional skills (WIP):

-   Sleight of Handš: Pickpocket(otherwise as stunt of stealth)

Unused Magical Skills: Only if magic exists in the setting. Atm I tend
more to the SotC-variant and suggest we go for a more backgroundy,
subtle kind of magic (less fireballs, more charms and figments).

-   Cost 1 permanent refresh
-   What they do:
    -   Add/transplant a trapping
    -   Extend a trapping
        -   +2 specific application, non-attack/defense
        -   +1 attack
        -   +2 result of successful attack
        -   1-2 expendable 2-shift effects (i.e. +two mild consequence)
        -   1 persisten 1-shif effect (i.e. armor 1 against
            certain things)
        -   -2 steps time required
        -   -2 difficulty of specific condition
        -   any 2 of above at half value
        -   sthg. more powerful if fate point spent
